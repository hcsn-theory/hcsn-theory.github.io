**Welcome.** This is the central research hub for the **Holographic Computational Spin-Network (HCSN)**.

We are developing a unified framework that derives quantum mechanics and general relativity from first principles, utilizing discrete computational processes on quantum hypergraphs.

## 💻 Simulation & Results: Cosmological Expansion Phase

We conducted a large-scale computational evolution of the HCSN hypergraph to test the "Emergent Big Bang" hypothesis. The simulation tracks the growth of a minimal quantum seed into a complex network structure.

**Run ID:** `SIM-2025-ALPHA`
**Duration:** 3000 Computational Steps
**Initial State:** $V_0 = 6$ (Minimal Seed)
**Dynamics:** Iterative Rewriting (Wolfram-style updates)

### 1. Growth Dynamics
The system exhibited a robust expansion phase. Unlike fixed-topology models, this run allowed for vertex creation, simulating the expansion of spacetime volume.

| Metric | Initial ($t=100$) | Final ($t=3000$) | Growth Factor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volume (Vertices)** | 6 | 1,557 | **259x** |
| **Avg Degree ($\langle k \rangle$)** | 2.50 | 9.27 | Stabilized |
| **Metric Dimension ($L$)** | 4 | 19 | Expanded |
| **Acceptance Rate** | 4.0% | 51.8% | Phase Transition |

> **Analysis:** The stabilization of the average degree $\langle k \rangle \approx 9.2$ is a critical result. It suggests that while the "universe" (Volume) is expanding rapidly, the *local density* remains constant, consistent with a homogeneous spacetime manifold.

#### Figure 3: Dimensionality Stabilization
The plot below tracks the average degree $\langle k \rangle$ over time. The plateau indicates the emergence of stable physical laws.

#### Figure 4: Phase Transition
The system underwent a transition at $t \approx 400$, marking the onset of the "inflationary" epoch.

### 3. Key Observations
* **Phase Transition:** At $t \approx 400$, the system underwent a transition from low acceptance (4%) to high acceptance (>50%), marking the onset of the "inflationary" epoch.
* **Dimensional Emergence:** The graph diameter ($L$) grew linearly with time, while volume ($V$) grew polynomially, consistent with a finite-dimensional emergent space.
* **Order Parameter ($\Omega$):** The order parameter $\Omega$ rose to $\approx 0.71$, indicating strong causal coherence in the final state.
