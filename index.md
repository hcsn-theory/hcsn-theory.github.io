# HCSN Research Group

**Welcome.** This is the central research hub for the **Holographic Computational Spin-Network (HCSN)**.

We are developing a unified framework that derives quantum mechanics and general relativity from first principles, utilizing discrete computational processes on quantum hypergraphs.

## 📚 Core Research

### [The HCSN Framework (Documentation)](https://hcsn-theory.github.io/HCSN-Theory/)
The complete theoretical foundation, including derivations of Einstein's equations, QFT emergence, and predictions for Lorentz violation.
* **Status:** Active / Documentation Live
* **Key Prediction:** Lorentz-violation parameter $\xi \approx 0.097$.

## 💻 Simulation & Results
*Numerical verification of the HCSN rewriting system.*

### Upcoming: Python Simulation Data
We are currently running Python simulations to model hypergraph evolution and verify the emergence of spacetime intervals.
* **Expected Output:** Visualizations of graph connectivity and causal growth.
* **Status:** Processing...

*(Once your results are ready, we will paste the graphs and data here!)*
